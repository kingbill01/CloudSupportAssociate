ACL.txt

An access control list (ACL) is a table 
that tells a computer operating system 
which access rights each user has 
to a particular system object, 
such as a file directory or individual 
file. 
Each object has a security attribute 
that identifies its access control list. 
The list has an entry for each system user 
with access privileges. 
The most common privileges include 
the ability to read a file (or all the files in a directory), 
to write to the file or files, and to execute the file 
(if it is an executable file, or program)
