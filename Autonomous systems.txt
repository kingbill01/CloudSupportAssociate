Autonomous systems.txt

First a little terminology. In the world of BGP, each routing domain is known as an autonomous system, or AS. 
What BGP does is help choose a path through the Internet, usually by selecting a route that traverses the least number of autonomous 
systems: the shortest AS path.

You might need BGP, for example, if your corporate network is connected to two large ISPs. To use BGP you would need an AS number, 
which you can get from the American Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN).

Once BGP is enabled, your router will pull a list of Internet routes from your BGP neighbors, who in this case will be your two ISPS. 
It will then scrutinize them to find the routes with the shortest AS paths. These will be put into the router's routing table. 
(If you only connect to a single ISP then you don't need BGP. That's because there's only one path to the Internet, so there's no need for a routing protocol to select the best path.)

Generally, but not always, routers will choose the shortest path to an AS. BGP only knows about these paths based on updates it receives.
