DHCP
Computer networks can be of any form 
like a LAN, WAN etc. If you are 
connected to a local LAN or an 
internet connection, the IP addresses 
form the basis of communication over 
computer networks. An IP address is 
the identity of a host or a computer 
device while connected to any network.

In most of the cases when you connect 
your computer to a LAN or internet, 
you’ll notice that the IP address 
and other information like subnet 
mask etc are assigned to your computer 
automatically. Have you ever thought 
about how this happens? Well, 
in this article we will understand 
the concept of DHCP that forms the 
basis of this functionality.

What is DHCP?

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol.

As the name suggests, DHCP is used to 
control the network configuration of 
a host through a remote server. 
DHCP functionality comes installed as 
a default feature in most of the 
contemporary operating systems. 
DHCP is an excellent alternative 
to the time-consuming manual 
configuration of network settings on 
a host or a network device.

Understanding DHCP helps in debugging 
many network related problems. 

How DHCP Works?

Before learning the process through 
which DHCP achieves it’s goal, 
we first have to understand the 
different messages that are used in 
the process.

1. DHCPDISCOVER

It is a DHCP message that marks the 
beginning of a DHCP interaction 
between client and server. 
This message is sent by a client 
(host or device connected to a 
network) that is connected to a 
local subnet. 
It’s a broadcast message that uses 
255.255.255.255 as destination IP 
address while the source IP address 
is 0.0.0.0

2. DHCPOFFER

It is DHCP message that is sent in 
response to DHCPDISCOVER by a DHCP 
server to DHCP client. This message 
contains the network configuration 
settings for the client that sent 
the DHCPDISCOVER message.

3. DHCPREQUEST

This DHCP message is sent in 
response to DHCPOFFER indicating 
that the client has accepted the 
network configuration sent in 
DHCPOFFER message from the server.

4. DHCPACK

This message is sent by the DHCP 
server in response to DHCPREQUEST 
recieved from the client. 
This message marks the end of the 
process that started with 
DHCPDISCOVER. 
The DHCPACK message is nothing but 
an acknowledgement by the DHCP 
server that authorizes the DHCP 
client to start using the network 
configuration it received from the 
DHCP server earlier.

5. DHCPNAK

This message is the exact opposite 
to DHCPACK described above. 
This message is sent by the DHCP 
server when it is not able to satisfy 
the DHCPREQUEST message from the 
client.

6. DHCPDECLINE

This message is sent from the DHCP 
client to the server in case the 
client finds that the IP address 
assigned by DHCP server is already 
in use.

7. DHCPINFORM

This message is sent from the DHCP 
client in case the IP address is 
statically configured on the client 
and only other network settings or 
configurations are desired to be 
dynamically acquired from DHCP server.

8. DHCPRELEASE

This message is sent by the DHCP 
client in case it wants to terminate 
the lease of network address it has 
be provided by DHCP server.



Now as we know about the various 
DHCP messages, it’s time to go 
through the the complete DHCP 
process to give a better Idea of how 
DHCP works. Note that the steps 
mentioned below assume that DHCP 
functionality is enabled by default 
on the client side.

Here are the steps :

Step 1: When the client computer 
(or device) boots up or is connected 
to a network, a DHCPDISCOVER message 
is sent from the client to the server. As there is no network configuration information on the client so the message is sent with 0.0.0.0 as source address and 255.255.255.255 as destination address. If the DHCP server is on local subnet then it directly receives the message or in case it is on different subnet then a relay agent connected on client’s  subnet is used to pass on the request to DHCP server. The transport protocol used for this message is UDP and the port number used is 67. The client enters the initializing stage during this step.

Step 2: When the DHCP server receives 
the DHCPDISCOVER request message then it replies with a DHCPOFFER message. As already explained, this message contains all the network configuration settings required by the client. For example, the yaddr field of the message will contain the IP address to be assigned to client. Similarly the the subnet mask and gateway information is filled in the options field. Also, the server fills in the client MAC address in the chaddr field. This message is sent as a broadcast (255.255.255.255) message for the client to receive it directly or if DHCP server is in different subnet then this message is sent to the relay agent that takes care of whether the message is to be passed as unicast or broadcast. In this case also, UDP protocol is used at the transport layer with destination port as 68. The client enters selecting stage during this step

Step 3: The client forms a 
DHCPREQUEST message in reply to 
DHCPOFFER message and sends it to the 
server indicating it wants to accept 
the network configuration sent in the 
DHCPOFFER message. 
If there were multiple DHCP servers 
that received DHCPDISCOVER then 
client could receive multiple 
DHCPOFFER messages. But, the client 
replies to only one of the messages 
by populating the server 
identification field with the IP 
address of a particular DHCP server. 
All the messages from other DHCP 
servers are implicitly declined. 
The DHCPREQUEST message will still 
contain the source address 
as 0.0.0.0 as the client is still 
not allowed to use the IP address 
passed to it through DHCPOFFER 
message. 
The client enters requesting stage 
during this step.

Step 4: Once the server receives 
DHCPREQUEST from the client, 
it sends the DHCPACK message 
indicating that now the client is 
allowed to use the IP address assigned to it. The client enters the bound state during this step.

The Concept of Lease

With all the necessary information 
on how DHCP works, one should also 
know that the IP  address assigned 
by DHCP server to DHCP client is on 
a lease. 
After the lease expires the DHCP 
server is free to assign the same 
IP address to any other host or 
device requesting for the same. 
For example, 
keeping lease time 8-10 hours is 
helpful in case of PC’s that are 
shut down at the end of the day.  
So, lease has to be renewed from 
time to time. The DHCP client tries 
to renew the lease after half of 
the lease time has expired. 
This is done by the exchange of 
DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK messages. 
While doing all this, 
the client enters the renewing stage.
